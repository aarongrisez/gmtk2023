# Laser Focused
Humans loved to give attention to cats--now the tables have turned... For too long, the elusive Red Dot tormented feline kind. The cats are in control now, keeping humans around only because cats can't be bothered to find their own food. Play as an endothermic quadruped (carniverous by nature), using the humans' own tools against them. Beware, humans tend to have short attention spans. You'll need to master the beams if you intend to keep your human Laser Focused on the task at hand...
